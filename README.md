Getting familiar with REACT again!!

dependencies I installed for local development:

react-router-dom (used Hashrouter for pages)
MUI library use npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled (I installed all dependencies)


This is a mock store front idea. Nothing will be functional just going through the basics of setting up a project.. Adding pages to the project. Also getting better with version control, I will push code and create a merge request to myself. I will then approve it as if I was adding from another branch, and merging it into a project for code review. 


Lessons learned:

I was trying to render Shop inside of itself, this creating a infinite loop. I need to add the items within my Shop and mapping through each item and rendering to the page..

Rendering image in objects make sure you don't capitalize it

Adding the button I keep forgetting to add export to my component!
