Getting Familar with REACT again!!

dependicies I installed:

react-router-dom (used Hashrouter for pages)


This is a mock store front idea. Nothing will be functional just going throught the basics of setting up a project.. Adding pages to the project. 


Lessons learned:

I was trying to render Shop inside of itself, this creating a infinitie loop. I need to add the items within my Shop and mapping through each item and rendering to the page..
